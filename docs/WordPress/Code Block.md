# Code Block


[Go back to the list of **Blocks**](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks/)

*Code* block lets you add and display code snippets for others to view.

*Code* block example:

```
if ( condition ) {
    action1();
    action2();
} elseif ( condition2 && condition3 ) {
    action3();
    action4();
} else {
    defaultaction();
}
```

To add the *Code* block, open the block inserter by clicking the (**+**) icon on the upper left corner of the editor. After that, look for Code using the search bar and click it to insert the block into the editor.
