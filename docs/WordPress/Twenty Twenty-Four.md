## [Full site editing support](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/twenty-twenty-four/#full-site-editing-support)

Twenty Twenty-Four is designed to support full site editing’s powerful features, including:

* [Site Editor](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/site-editor/): an editor that allows you to edit all parts of your site, navigate between templates, and more.
* [Styles](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/styles-overview/): a feature that allows you to customize your site, including individual blocks, as much as you’d like with different colors, typography, layouts, and more.
* [Templates](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/template-editor/): edit, create, and manage templates used by pages, posts, and other content.
* [Template parts](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/template-part-block/): a way to organize and display groups of blocks as part of a block template mainly for site structure, like Headers and Footers.
* Theme blocks including the [Navigation block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/navigation-block/),[ Query Loop block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/query-loop-block/), and more.

Like its predecessor Twenty Twenty-Three, this theme is designed to use WordPress site-editing features *instead of* the Customizer, which will be hidden by default. The Customizer may be automatically reactivated if you have plugins that require it.

## [One theme, many variations](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/twenty-twenty-four/#one-theme-many-variations)

In the past, default themes often centered around a specific topic or style. However, Twenty Twenty-Four breaks away from this tradition. This theme is thoughtfully designed to be your all-encompassing choice for any type of website, regardless of its specific focus.
