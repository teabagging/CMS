# File block


[Go back to the list of **Blocks**](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks/)

The **File Block** allows you to add a link to the downloadable files on your website.

In this video, you can see how to use the file block and the different settings to customize it.

**How to add a File block to your post or page**:

1. To add a **File block,** use the **Block Inserter** (+), or you can type `/file` in a new paragraph block and press enter.

2. To add a file, you can use the upload button to upload your files directly from your computer, or you can click **Media Library** to add files from your media library.

After you add a file, you can edit the file name by typing inside the rectangle. You can click **Replace** to replace the file and upload another one. You can click **Copy URL** to copy the URL of the file.

## [Block toolbar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/file-block/#block-toolbar)

Every block comes with unique toolbar icons and block-specific user controls that allow you to manipulate the block right in the editor.

The File block has seven buttons:

* Transform to
* Drag icon
* Move handles
* Change alignment
* Replace
* Copy URL
* More options

[![Block toolbar in the File block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-21-at-11.45.49-AM.png)](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-21-at-11.45.49-AM.png)

**Transform to:**

When you click on the **Transform** button you can convert the File block into a Group, Columns, or Image block.

![Transform tool in the File Block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-21-at-11.51.40-AM.png)

The Group gives you the ability to change the background color around the File block.

**Drag icon**

![Drag icon in the File Block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-21-at-11.53.48-AM.png)

To drag and drop the block to a new location on the page template, click and hold the rectangle of dots, then drag to the new location. The blue separator line indicates where the block will be placed. Release the left mouse button when you find the new location to place the block.

**Move handles**

![Move handles in the File Block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-21-at-12.09.23-PM.png)

The up and down arrow icons can be used to move a block up and down on the page.

**Change Alignment**

![Change alignment in the File Block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-21-at-12.12.16-PM.png)

Using the alignment drop-down from the toolbar, you can align the file block to the left, make it center-aligned, or align it to the right. You can also make the *file block* wide width and full width.

### [Replace](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/file-block/#replace)

Using the Replace button, you can replace your file by uploading a new one from your device or adding another one from your media library.

![Replace file in the File Block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-21-at-12.14.18-PM.png)

### [Copy URL](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/file-block/#copy-url)

**More rich text controls**

Clicking on the file name in the File block will display three more buttons in the Block Toolbar – Bold, Italic, and More Rich Text controls.

![Rich Text controls in the File Block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-21-at-12.21.38-PM.png)

Use the “Bold” option or “Ctrl+B” / “Cmd+B” on your keyboard to bold it, which is usually heavier than the surrounding text.

![Bold option in the File Block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-21-at-12.31.33-PM.png)

Use the “Italic” option or “Ctrl+I” / “Cmd+I” on your keyboard to italicize it, which usually appears slanted to the right.

### [More rich text controls](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/file-block/#more-rich-text-controls)

**Inline code**

Use the Inline code feature to format code snippets within your text differently. Not only that, but Inline code formatting also prevents the code to be executed instead of displayed.

**Inline image**

The Inline image feature allows you to add an image to your block. It has one option: enter the desired pixel width for your image.

**Keyboard Input**

The Keyboard Input option allows you to add the `<kbd>` tag to selected text.

**Strikethrough**

Use the Strikethrough option to place a horizontal line through the middle of the selected text.

Example: ~File Block~

**Subscript**

Use the Subscript option to set the selected text slightly below the normal line of type.

Example: File ~Block~

**Superscript**

Use the Superscript option to set the selected text slightly above the normal line of type.

Example: File ^Block^

### [More options](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/file-block/#more-options)

The [More Options menu](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/more-options) represented by **three vertical dots on the far right of the toolbar** gives you more features such as the ability to duplicate, remove, or edit your block as HTML.

[Read about these and other settings.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/more-options/)

## [Block settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/file-block/#block-settings)

Every block has specific options in the editor sidebar in addition to the options found in the block toolbar. If you do not see the sidebar, simply click the **cog** icon next to the **Publish** or **Update** button.

![Cog icon in the File Block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-21-at-12.39.18-PM.png)

The File block offers the following settings

### [Settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/file-block/#settings)

You can choose whether to link to the media file directly or a separate attachment page by using the drop-down menu. If you want the media file/attachment page to open in a new tab, enable the **Open in a new tab** button.

The File block comes with a **Download** button that can be toggled on and off using the **Show download button**.

By toggling it off, the file name will appear as a link.

If you upload a PDF file, you’ll see a PDF settings section on the block settings.

![PDF settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/11/image2.png)

You can embed PDF on your page or post by enabling the **Show inline embed** option. When it’s enabled, you’ll see the **height in pixels** setting that lets you adjust the PDF display by using the slider or entering a value in pixels.

**Advanced**

The **Advanced** tab lets you add HTML anchor and CSS class(es) to your block.

[![Advanced tab in the File Block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/11/Screenshot-2022-11-16-at-10.41.25-AM.png)](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/11/Screenshot-2022-11-16-at-10.41.25-AM.png)
The advanced section lets you add HTML anchor and a CSS class to your block.

**HTML anchor** allows you to [make a unique web address](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/page-jumps/) for the File block. Then, you’ll be able to link directly to the File block on your page.

The **Additional CSS class(es)** lets you add CSS class(es) to your block, allowing you to write custom CSS and style the block as you see fit.
