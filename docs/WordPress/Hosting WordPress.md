# Hosting WordPress


To get your WordPress up and running, you’re going to need a web server. Most hosting providers have the technical specifications required for WordPress.

In general, hosting providers offer:

* *Generic* hosting, meant for different web applications (including WordPress, but also other software as well)
* *WordPress-specific* hosting

WordPress-specific hosting providers offer a platform designed for installing WordPress, or even pre-installed WordPress. They may also offer additional features such as backups, updates or developer tools.

See the subsection [Hosting providers](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/hosting-wordpress/#hosting-providers) for more information and provider suggestions.

## [Technical requirements](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/hosting-wordpress/#technical-requirements)

Please refer to [this page](https://wordpress.org/about/requirements/) with the recommended server software. The page is updated with the latest minimum requirements to run WordPress. You’ll also find a pre-written letter you can use to contact a potential hosting provider.

If your server is not configured properly, your site may not function as intended, or you won’t be able to install WordPress. This is why ensuring your server meets the technical requirements is essential.

If you are new to WordPress, it may be a good idea to have your site hosted by a provider with experience in WordPress hosting.
