### ILLA
ILLA is a robust open source low-code platform for developers to build internal tools. By using ILLA's library of Components and Actions, developers can save massive amounts of time on building tools. 



## 🚀Get Started
To try ILLA, the most convenient way is to sign up and log in to [ILLA Cloud](https://cloud.illacloud.com?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=github-readme). 

You can also deploy and [self-host](https://docs.illacloud.com/self-hosted-deployment/) ILLA utils manually([Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), and [k8s](https://kubernetes.io/)).

3. 🖥 **Self-hosted:** supports Docker & k8s
4. 📝 **Page Support:** The base of creating a content-rich and UI-friendly tool.
5. 🎨 **Powered by [ILLA Design](https://github.com/illacloud/illa-design):** Components should not constrain your imagination.

## How to build your tool

#### 🎯 Step 1: Connect to your database



#### 🎨 Step 2: Build UI with built-in components
Build your UI by dragging components to the canvas. We provide dozens of components including charts, tables, forms, and many more in Illa Builder and Illa Design. When components overlap, their position will be automatically adjusted, which makes the layout development easy and flexible.




#### 🔌 Step 3: Connect to your data
Connect to MySQL or REST API through our GUI data connectors. We will add more than 10 databases and APIs soon.



#### 🚀 Step 4: Deploy your app
Deploy your app and self-host it.
