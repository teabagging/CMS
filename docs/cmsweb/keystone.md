## Usage & Documentation

Keystone 6 is published to npm under the `@keystone-6/*` namespace.

You can find our extended documentation on our [website](https://keystonejs.com/docs), but some quick links that might be helpful:

- Read [Why Keystone](https://keystonejs.com/why-keystone) to learn about our vision and what's in the box.
- [Getting Started](https://keystonejs.com/docs/getting-started) walks you through first steps with the `create-keystone-app` CLI.
- Our [Examples](./examples) contain a growing collection of projects you can run locally to learn more about a [Keystone feature](https://keystonejs.com/why-keystone#features).
- An [API Reference](https://keystonejs.com/docs/apis) contains the details on Keystone's foundational building blocks.
- Some [Guides](https://keystonejs.com/docs/guides/overview) offer practical walkthroughs on how to build with those blocks.

> üí° While our `API Reference` is generally complete, we are are still working hard on increasing the fidelity of our `guides` and `examples`. If you have an example you'd like see, please [open a GitHub discussion](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/discussions/new)!

Our `@keystone-6/*` packages are written for the [Node Maintenance and Active LTS](https://github.com/nodejs/Release) versions of Node; and our continuous integration seamlessly tracks that.
You may have success with Node versions that are Pending or End-of-Life, but you may have problems too.
