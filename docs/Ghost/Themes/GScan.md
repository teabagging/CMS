# GScan

Validating your Ghost theme is handled efficiently with the GScan tool. GScan will check your theme for errors, deprecations and compatibility issues. GScan is used in several ways:

* The [GScan site](https://gscan.ghost.org/) is your first port of call to test any themes that youâ€™re building to get a full validation report
* When a theme is uploaded in Ghost admin, it will automatically be checked with `gscan` and any fatal errors will prevent the theme from being used
* `gscan` is also used as a command line tool

### Command line

To use GScan as a command line tool, globally install the `gscan` npm package:

```bash
# Install the npm package
npm install -g gscan

# Use gscan <file path> anywhere to run gscan against a folder
gscan /path/to/ghost/content/themes/casper

# Run gscan on a zip file
gscan -z /path/to/download/theme.zip
```
