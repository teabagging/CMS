# License

Ghost is free software released under the [MIT License](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License), which pretty much means you can do anything you want with it. The MIT License is one of the most free and open licenses in the world, and does not restrict how you use the software which it’s applied to. We believe open source software should be free. As in free.

You are allowed to use Ghost however you like, but any copyright notices remain in tact. With the MIT license you have the same freedom to decide how you want to engage with Open Source software. You decide whether your theme or integration is MIT, GPL, or any license you like.

It’s up to you to determine what’s best for your project. We believe giving people a choice is the most powerful statement a license can make. The full license is embedded below, and ships with every single copy of Ghost.
