# Contributing to Ghost

Ghost is completely open source software built almost entirely by volunteer contributors who use it every day.

The best part about structuring a software project this way is that not only does everyone get to own the source code without restriction, but as people all over the world help to improve it: Everyone benefits.

## Core team

In addition to [full time product team](https://ghost.org/about/) working for Ghost Foundation, there are a number of community members who have contributed to the project for a lengthy period of time and are considered part of the core team. They are:

* [Austin Burdine](https://github.com/acburdine) - Ghost-CLI
* [Felix Rieseberg](https://github.com/felixrieseberg) - Ghost Desktop
* [Vicky Chijwani](https://github.com/vickychijwani) - Ghost Mobile
* [David Balderston](https://github.com/dbalders) - Community

#### How core team members are added

People typically invited to join the Core Team officially after an extended period of successful contribution to Ghost and demonstrating good judgement. In particular, this means having humility, being open to feedback and changing their mind, knowing the limits of their abilities and being able to communicate all of these things such that it is noticed. Good judgement is what produces trust, not quality, quantity or pure technical skill.

When we believe a core contributor would make a great ambassador for Ghost and feel able to trust them to make good decisions about its future - that’s generally when we’ll ask them to become a member of the formal Core Team.

Core Team members are granted commit rights to Ghost projects, access to the Ghost Foundation private Slack, and occasionally join our international team retreats.

## Community guidelines

All participation in the Ghost community is subject to our incredibly straightforward [code of conduct](https://ghost.org/conduct/) and wider [community guidelines](https://forum.ghost.org/t/faq-guidelines/5).

The vast majority of the Ghost community is incredible, and we work hard to make sure it stays that way. We always welcome people who are friendly and participate constructively, but we outright ban anyone who is behaving in a poisonous manner.

We’re happy to extend a flexible usage license of the Ghost trademark to community projects, companies and individuals, however it please read the **[Ghost trademark usage policy](https://ghost.org/trademark/)** before using the Ghost name in your project.

## Development guide

If you’re a developer looking to help, but you’re not sure where to begin: Check out the [good first issue](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/labels/good%20first%20issue) label on GitHub, which contains small pieces of work that have been specifically flagged as being friendly to new contributors.

Or, if you’re looking for something a little more challenging to sink your teeth into, there’s a broader [help wanted](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/labels/help%20wanted) label encompassing issues which need some love.

When you’re ready, check out the full **[Ghost Contributing Guide](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)** for detailed instructions about how to hack on Ghost Core and send changes upstream.

## Other ways to help

The primary way to contribute to Ghost is by writing code, but if you’re not a developer there are still ways you can help. We always need help with:

* Helping our Ghost users on [the forum](https://forum.ghost.org/)
* Creating tutorials and guides
* Testing and quality assurance
* Hosting local events or meetups
* Promoting Ghost to others

There are lots of ways to make discovering and using Ghost a better experience.
