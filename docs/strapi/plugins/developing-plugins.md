# Developing Strapi plugins

:::info
This section is about developing Strapi plugins to use them as local plugins or to submit them to the Marketplace. Not what you're looking for? Read the [plugins introduction](/dev-docs/plugins) and find your use case and recommended section to read from there.
:::

Strapi allows the development of plugins that work exactly like the built-in plugins or 3rd-party plugins available from the [Marketplace](https://market.strapi.io). Once created, your plugin can be:

- used as a local plugin, working only with a specific Strapi project,
- or [submitted to the Marketplace](https://market.strapi.io/submit-plugin) to be shared with the community.

1. [Create a plugin](/dev-docs/plugins/development/create-a-plugin) using the CLI-based generator.
2. Learn more about the [structure of a plugin](/dev-docs/plugins/development/plugin-structure).
3. Get an overview of the [plugin APIs](#plugin-apis) to add features to your plugin.
4. Read some [guides](#guides) based on your use case(s).
