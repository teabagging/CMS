# Project deployment with Strapi Cloud

You have 2 options to deploy your project with Strapi Cloud:

- either with the user interface (UI), meaning that you will perform all the actions directly on the Strapi Cloud dashboard,
- or using the Cloud Comment Line Interface (CLI), meaning that you will only interact with a terminal.

The guides below will guide you through all the steps for each of the deployment options.
